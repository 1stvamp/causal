Causal Docs

0. Intro
Firstly causal and its developers are not associated with any of the services we integrate with.

All integration is don using publicly available APIs. Where extra permission is required we ask the logged in user to provide us/causal with permission to access their data using the API supplied by the service owner.

0.1 Design
We have broken each service we integrate with in a Django application. Each service can enabled from local.settings.py like so:

INSTALLED_SERVICES = (
    'causal.twitter',
    'causal.foursquare',
    #'causal.flickr',
    #'causal.feed',
    #'causal.facebook',
    #'causal.github',
    #'causal.lastfm',
    #'causal.googlereader',
)
This enables only Foursqaure and Twitter services to the user to integrate with.

0.2 Run Modes
Causal can be run as multi user service by enabling user registration in local.settings.py as so:

ENABLE_REGISTRATION = True

This will allow users to register with the site user the django-registration app. This will email the user after sign up with a link to validate their email address.

If multi user access isnt required as for example you wish to run you own causal instance just for your updates set ENABLE_REGISTRATION = False to disable user registration. You will then need to register a user by hand in the admin interface, locate at http://HOSTNAME:PORT/_ca-admin That is the default address of the admin interface.

2. Upcoming

We had our own ideas of where we wanted to lead the project but we decided its the users who know best. With this in mind we are open to suggestions for improvements and feature requests. Email us at team@causal.com or find the current ticket list at: http://github.com/causality/causal/issues
